Practicing My Machine Learning Techniques on Baseball Data

The best source of advanced baseball analytics, to my current knowledge, is Baseball Savant (https://baseballsavant.mlb.com/statcast_search).
The website can be used for a wide variety of highly specific analytics collected with regads to pitched and batted balls.

Algorithms in this prject are kept as general as possible, for use on any prooject, however, they have been designed with the this specific use in mind.
